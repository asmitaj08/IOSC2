# IOSC2: Identification & analysis of Outdated Software Components and corresponding CVEs in IoT firmware


Abstract â€” Third-party software components (TPCs) are an integral part of industrial products. Vulnerabilities in TPCs could impact the entire product segment. There are existing software component analysis tools for generic software-based products, but the identification of TPCs and associated vulnerabilities still need to be explored more in embedded firmware binaries. As part of this project, we have targeted real-world embedded firmware binaries for IoT devices (Routers & Cameras) to identify the TPCs (we refer to them further as packages), corresponding versions of the packages,  and associated existing CVEs with respect to different third-party packages used in these devices. 

We have performed static analysis on 107 firmware datasets to address our research questions:
RQ1: What are the commonly found third-party software components in IoT devices' firmware? 
RQ2: How likely is it to find outdated software components in such firmware?
RQ3: What are the corresponding existing vulnerabilities w.r.t those software components?

The analysis shows an alarming scenario. Most of these devices use third-party packages that are outdated, hence the vulnerabilities related to the outdated version of the packages still persist in these devices. The rate at which these third-party packages are updated is not the same as the update rate of the firmware. Moreover, even with the update in the firmware versions, not all the third-party packages are updated showing an alarming security risk to these devices.
